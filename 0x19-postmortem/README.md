Author: Jimmy Maina
GitHub Repository: 3D Maze Game
Published: September 2024

Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage:
The project faced significant technical setbacks between August 10, 2024, and August 17, 2024. These issues caused delays in development but did not result in a full-scale outage.

Impact:
Core functionalities, including accurate wall rendering and SDL2 integration, were impaired. This led to slower development progress and occasional disruptions during testing. Developers experienced performance bottlenecks and rendering inaccuracies, affecting overall productivity and project timelines.

Root Cause:

Raycasting Algorithm Complexity:

The algorithm, crucial for rendering walls, was more complex than anticipated. This complexity led to performance issues and inaccuracies in wall rendering.
SDL2 Integration Issues:

Challenges with SDL2’s event handling and rendering efficiency created bottlenecks, affecting the user experience and game performance.
Timeline
August 10, 2024: Project repository established on GitHub with initial README.md outlining goals and installation instructions.

August 11-13, 2024: Implemented a basic SDL2 window and began integrating the raycasting algorithm for wall rendering.

August 14, 2024: Identified major issues with raycasting accuracy and SDL2 event handling. Performance slowdowns and rendering inaccuracies became apparent.

August 15, 2024: Initiated troubleshooting for SDL2 integration. Reviewed SDL2 documentation and ran small-scale test programs to better understand event handling and rendering.

August 16, 2024: Focused on refining the raycasting algorithm based on feedback. Improved time management with a structured schedule and clear milestones.

August 17, 2024: Implemented improvements to both the raycasting algorithm and SDL2 integration, resulting in better performance and accuracy.

Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:

Raycasting Algorithm Complexity:

The algorithm’s intricacy was underestimated, leading to difficulties with accurate wall rendering and performance inefficiencies.
SDL2 Integration:

Issues stemmed from a lack of familiarity with SDL2’s features and insufficient event-handling mechanisms.
Resolution:

Raycasting Algorithm:

Dedicated time to researching and refining the algorithm. Leveraged online tutorials, documentation, and community forums to enhance accuracy and performance. Iterative testing and improvements led to a more robust implementation.
SDL2 Integration:

Conducted a thorough review of SDL2 documentation and engaged in extensive hands-on testing. Gained a deeper understanding of SDL2’s event handling and rendering processes, resulting in smoother performance.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:

Algorithm Optimization:

Regularly review and refine the raycasting algorithm. Incorporate peer feedback and user testing results to ensure ongoing performance and accuracy.
SDL2 Documentation and Practices:

Maintain up-to-date SDL2 documentation and create a troubleshooting guide for common integration issues. Establish best practices for SDL2 integration to streamline future development.
Tasks to Address Issues:

Raycasting Algorithm:

Continue refining based on feedback and performance metrics.
Document the development process and key decisions.
SDL2 Integration:

Develop a comprehensive guide for SDL2 integration.
Implement automated tests to catch performance issues early.
Time Management:
